```{r}
#1. Use the help(?) function to learn more about the dataset. 
```

```{r}
#2. Use vis_dat to check out the data. Does it need cleaning?
```
Yes. 
```{r}
#3. Fit a linear model to the cleaned data to predict Ozone from one of the possible predictors of your choosing. Why did you chose that variable? 
```
Temperature affects air quality due to its role in chemical reactions in the atmosphere.
```{r}
#4. Using summary(),  does this seem like a valid model? 
```
Yes. 
```{r}
#5. Explain the R^2 found in a sentance. 
```
The model explains 0.49% of the variability in Ozone levels using Temperature as a predictor.
```{r}
#6. Use broom:augment to predict the Ozone of the cleaned data. 
```

```{r}
#7. Use ggplot2 to plot the actual vs. predicted Ozone. 
```
